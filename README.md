# YoutubeAPI
my youtube api application using Node and the google client library package.. to pull down  videos from a particular channel... 

worked quite well.. but then its not yet completed.. im trying to add comments to the videos... as you would on youtube when watching ...

kerp in mind that google has a limit for api-calls on free-accounts.. and jyst incase you desire to have unlimited access, its paid..

pull, modify and if any changes request an issue amd rather than forking the project... you become a contributor..
